# AntiChatReport
This simple plugin stops people from being able to report each othrt

How does it work?

Actually, it's fuc**** (oops, no swearing, new Minecraft rule) simple, when a player sends a chat message, the message is not gonna go through, instead, the server takes the text and sends it, that way the clients think it's a server message not from a player, and it can't be reported!
